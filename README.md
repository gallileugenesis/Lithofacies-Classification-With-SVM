# Lithofacies classification using the Support Vector Machine 

The prediction of the spatial properties, mainly of lithology (lithofacies), is decisive for the success of production in oil reservoirs. This prediction can be guided by the association of physical and seismic data obtained from the wells.

In this case study, features will be well log data from eight gas wells. These wells have already had lithofacies classes assigned based on core descriptions. After training the classifier will be able to assign facies in the wells that have not lithologic identification.

This notebook will apply the Machine Learning technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM), for the automatic classification of lithofacies of well logs based on the data provided in the Geophysical Tutorial Machine Learning Contest 2016  (https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest).
